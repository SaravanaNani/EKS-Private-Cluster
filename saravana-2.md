## üìÇ Professional Experience

### **Adaequare Info Pvt Ltd ‚Äì Hyderabad, Telangana**  
**Associate Cloud DevOps Engineer | Apr 2025 ‚Äì Present**  
**Graduate Engineer Trainee | Feb 2024 ‚Äì Mar 2025**

- Led design, build, and operationalization of **in-house production-style projects** covering cloud automation and cluster observability while working independently end-to-end.
- Performed platform engineering for Kubernetes (EKS) clusters, secure ingress, monitoring pipelines, and persistent storage with AWS services and K8s CSI.

**Key responsibilities & outcomes**
- Implemented and operated **Kubernetes (EKS)** clusters and worker pools; maintained kubeconfig, node lifecycle, and cluster autoscaling configurations.
- Designed, installed, and configured **NGINX Ingress Controller** and TLS automation via **cert-manager** (Let‚Äôs Encrypt) for secure external access to dashboards and apps.
- Built a **hybrid observability stack**:
  - **Prometheus Operator** (in-cluster) for metrics collection and alerting.
  - **Node Exporter**, **cAdvisor**, **kube-state-metrics** for node/pod/container metrics.
  - **Promtail** (DaemonSet) on EKS to forward logs to Bastion-hosted **Loki**.
  - **Grafana** hosted on Bastion for unified dashboards combining Prometheus metrics and Loki logs.
- Deployed **EBS CSI driver** with IRSA and created **gp3 StorageClass** for Prometheus persistent volumes; documented IAM policy and eksctl commands for reproducible setup.
- Implemented **Kyverno ClusterPolicies** to protect critical namespaces and enforced admission controls to prevent accidental deletion of `default`, `kube-system`, `monitoring`, and `adq-dev`.
- Automated verification and validation processes using Python and shell scripts for post-deployment checks, certificate/ingress health, and Prometheus target validation.
- Troubleshot and remediated cluster-level issues: Metrics Server conflicts with EKS add-ons, Prometheus CRD issues, Promtail connectivity to Loki, and NLB/Ingress health checks.
- Produced comprehensive documentation for the platform: installation steps, YAML manifests, runbooks, and troubleshooting guides.

**In-house Projects (selected)**

**AFRA ‚Äî EKS Monitoring & Observability (In-house project)**  
- Designed and implemented a complete monitoring pipeline for AFRA: Prometheus Operator, ServiceMonitors/PodMonitors, Grafana dashboards, Loki log aggregation, and Promtail DaemonSet.  
- Implemented node-level exporters (Node Exporter & cAdvisor) for system and container metrics and configured Prometheus scrape discovery via ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor resources.  
- Configured secure access to monitoring endpoints (Ingress + cert-manager TLS).  
- Implemented gp3-backed PVCs for Prometheus data retention and created IRSA role for the EBS CSI controller.  
- Authored operational runbooks, Grafana dashboard JSON imports, and automated validation scripts.

**GCP Infrastructure Automation (In-house project)**  
- Automated GCP resource provisioning and configuration using **Terraform** modules and Ansible for post-provisioning tasks.  
- Developed Jenkins pipelines for automated deployment; integrated secrets with GCP Secret Manager and artifact storage in GCS.  
- Implemented monitoring hooks to export metrics to Prometheus and dashboards for visibility.
